# How to make predictions on stage2 heldout testset

1. Prepare test data (R1~R11)
  Download all stage 2 test data files & Move them to '$BASE_DIR/0_data' folder
    e.g.,  R1.zip should be located in '$BASE_DIR/0_data/R1/R1.zip'
  Unzip each one of them
    e.g.,  cd $BASE_DIR/0_data/R1
           unzip R1.zip
  '$BASE_DIR/0_data/R1/test' folder should exist now

2. Run predictions (Warning: there should be a few hundred GB disk space available to store intermediate output files)
  cd $BASE_DIR/test
  ./test.sh
  
3. Stage 2 core     task test submission file will be at   $BASE_DIR/test/submit/submit.zip
   Stage 2 transfer task test submission file will be at   $BASE_DIR/test/submit2/submit2.zip
